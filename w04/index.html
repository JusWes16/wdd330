                You can use document.forms to access the forms on a page. Access a specific form use the bracket notation.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use the form.elements notation to access the elements of a form, or you can get a specific
                element by using its given name attribute. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use event listeners to alter and control what is shown in a forms input field.

            <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
            <p>
                Parentheses are not always required when initializing a new instance of a class. It is only needed if
                you are passing values to the class creation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A constructor function is used to create an instance of a class. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The 'this' keyword is used to access attributes and methods defined in the class. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A static method can be called. It is different because it is called by the class instead of an instance of the class. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the 'extends' keyword you can define a second class that inherits all of the attributes and methods from 
                previous class. 
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

                Using an MVC approach helps create well organized and functional programs. It seperates logic and views into their or files.

                Templates are very useful and helpful for implementing javascript into your html documents. Templates like
                EJS, Pug, and Handlebars all allow you to do this but in different ways.
