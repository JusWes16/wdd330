    <h1>WDD 330 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Week 05</h2>

    <p>No exercises just notes from the book. I also used some of the debugging concepts on some other code I am working on.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 10</h3>
    <p>
        Typical errors:
        <ul>
            <li>System error – there is a problem with the system or external devices</li>
            <li>Programmer error – the program has some sort of error because of how it was written. (syntax, typo, etc.)</li>
            <li>User error – incorrect data from the user that the program didn’t expect and could handle</li>
        </ul>

        Different types of errors that can be returned:

        <ol>
            <li>Exceptions: returns a return value to help deal with the error</li>
            <li>Stack Traces: a sequence of functions or methods that lead to where the error occurred</li>
            <li>Warnings: a potential error in the code that isn’t a big enough deal to crash the program</li>
        </ol>
        
        Strict Mode throws more errors and warning because it is considering old practices and methods as and error or warning. 

        <div>
            Debugging in the browser:
            <ol>
                <li>Using alerts</li>
                <li>Using the console</li>
                <li>Breakpoints in the console</li>
                <li>Error objects</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        You can also use exception handling with try, catch and finally blocks
