                You can use the call() method to allow you to use the this
                value in the function itself for only the first argument that is passed in. 
                You can use the call() method without using this in the functionbut this would require you to pass in null
                as the first argument into the function. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The apply method() wors the same as the call() method except for that 
                arguments are provided as an array.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use cache to store the results of functions that might
                take some time to complete. Then instead of waiting for the 
                function to compute the result again it can instead just retured the 
                stored valuse from cache.

                Callback Hell is a term to define the complex "spagetti code"
                that can often arise from too many nested callbacks. You want to 
                try to avoid this if posible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Promises do all of the same things as callbacks 
                but in a much cleaner and simpler way.</button>

                Ajax is an acronym which stands for, Asynchronous, JavaScript,
                XML. It is a way of coding that allows the page to update without
                a full reload by using JavaScript and originally XML documents. 
                JSON is used more now.

                By using the fetch() method, you can retrieve data from
                a URL and then choose what to do with that data and information
                once you get it.
