            <h3>Chapter 9</h3>
            <p>
                Global variables are actually properties of the 'window' object.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the most part you will not see variables being called with the window object
                (let x = 4; window.x). The exception to this is when you are checking to see if a global variable
                has been defined(if (x) => if(window.x))
            </p>
            <p>
                Window.location holds information on the URL of the current page. There are also 
                many properties that come with the window.location object(ex. href, protocol, host, etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Window.history can be used to get information on any sites that were visited
                previously on this current browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Window.screen contains information on the screen that is being displayed. Information
                like the height and width can be accessed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The window object also has the well knows 'document' object which allows you to access
                the information from the page that is currently loaded. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Timing functions are also apart of the window object that allow you to run functions 
                based on a certain amount of time. Using setTimeout() method allows you to run a function
                after a certain amount of time has passed in milliseconds. You can also use the setInterval()
                method to run a function every set amount of time in milliseconds. 
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
            <p>The data- attibute can be used to embed data into the web page to be used by the 
                JavaScript program. It is a way to set customized attributes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When retrieving information from a data- attribute you call it similar to other attibutes 
                but the data- is dropped and only what follows is what is needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The window object has properties called localStorage and sessionStorage. Information 
                is saved in key-value pairs and is saved locally on either your current session or browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                The notification API allows programmers to show messages using the users system's notifications. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Introduced by HTML5 is the audo and video tags making it much easier to add video and audio to
                your website.
